## Churn rate

Churn rate, sometimes known as attrition rate, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time. Churn may also apply to the number of subscribers who cancel or don't renew a subscription. The higher your churn rate, the more customers stop buying from your business.
