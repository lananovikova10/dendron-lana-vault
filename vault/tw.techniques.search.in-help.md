# In-help search 

It can be hard to find relevant information in large documentations, that’s why most of the users use search. 
We are all children of the web now, and we come to any information system looking for the search box, and expecting the search to work like Google. 

## Heatmap

If you look at the heat map we bet you’ll see many clicks and interactions around the search query area and less around the TOC.

## Metrics 

- Precision
- Recall
- Accuracy
- Zero searches rate
- Search page exits

## Synonims

“Design vocabulary” used by the technical communicator to build the search system doesn’t match the search vocabulary the user is possessing.
