- Do they need a writer?
- Audence analysis is a must for a startup
Some will write good drafts, which then I "translate for normal people" in most cases
- What tools?
- Will templates help?

- Really loving this talk about how documentation can facilitate effective incident response from the
@splunk docs team.

- Motivated by anxiety and fear.
- Thin line between courage and stupidity
